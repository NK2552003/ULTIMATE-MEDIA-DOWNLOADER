# Uninstallation Guide - Ultimate Media Downloader

## Quick Uninstall (Recommended)

Run this single command to uninstall:

```bash
./scripts/uninstall.sh
```

This will:

- Uninstall the package and all its dependencies
- Clean up Python packages
- **Keep your downloaded files safe** - they won't be deleted!

## Manual Uninstallation

If you prefer to uninstall manually or the script doesn't work, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Uninstall the Python Package

```bash
pip3 uninstall -y ultimate-downloader
```

or if you used `pipx`:

```

### Step 2: Remove the Command (Optional)

If the `umd` command is still accessible, check where it's installed:

```bash
which umd
```

Then remove it manually:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
sudo rm $(which umd)

# Or find and remove from your local bin
rm ~/.local/bin/umd
```

### Step 3: Clean Up Dependencies (Optional)

If you want to remove yt-dlp and other dependencies:

```bash
pip3 uninstall -y yt-dlp spotdl colorama requests
```

python3 -m pip uninstall ultimate-downloader
```
